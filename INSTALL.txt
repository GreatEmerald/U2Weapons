====INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS====

This is the Full Install package. If you like this, you should really try out 
UTXMP, it's a great game that can be integrated straight into UT2004 with some 
pathing. Or you can try U2XMP for better graphics and more players.

Anyway, since RC2 Unreal II/XMP Weapons for UT2004 no longer requires you to 
have UTXMP, and the installation is quite generic. All you need to do is either 
extract the RAR file to your UT2004 folder, or manually move files (for example, 
if you have the folder named System in this archive, move all the contents to 
your UT2004/System folder). Note that if you wish to save space and have UTXMP 
installed and pathed to your main UT2004, you can extract the archive to the 
UTXMP folder instead. Finally, if you wish to create an Unreal II weapons 
server, you have to add the package "U2Weapons" to ServerPackages: Open the 
UT2004/System/UT2004.ini file again. Find the [Engine.GameEngine] header, and 
add these lines below the "ServerPackages=OnslaughtFull" line:

ServerPackages=GEUtilities
ServerPackages=ShieldReward
ServerPackages=U2Stations
ServerPackages=U2Weapons

Save the UT2004.ini file.

The installation is complete. To get the weapons, enable the Unreal II/XMP 
Weapons mutator from the game's Mutator menu, to get the stations, enable Unreal 
II Power Stations, and to get the dropped shields, enable Shield Reward.
